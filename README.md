# AmongUsProxy
Not a proxy, but a sniffer. Yeah, some things come out different than planned...

Uses [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) for the [Hazel Provider (and Hazel in general)](https://github.com/willardf/Hazel-Networking).

Uses Pcap to sniff packets, so you need that installed (WinPcap didn't work for me, so I used Npcap).

Supposed to print out informations like "Player x killed Player y" or "Player x vented", inspired by a program on unknowncheats (which never got released? idk).  
For best results, start the "Proxy" before you join the round, so it can get the player names.
